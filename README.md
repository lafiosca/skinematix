A Twitter bot by @joelafiosca for sharing thrilling, erotic musings. It awakens hourly to tweet a random sentence from a plot summary of a Wikipedia article about an erotic thriller film.

The wikifetch library being used only includes wiki reference links in the article text, surrounded by double brackets, but does not include their alternate text. For example:

    That same night, a prostitute walks into a fleabag motel to meet a [[John_(prostitution)]] â€” and is instead mauled by a black panther.

I could try to modify the library, but I am lazy, and this is more absurd.
